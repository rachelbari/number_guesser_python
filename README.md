# Python Number Guesser Game
In this project, you will build a number guessing game to play in the command line. The python program randomly generates a random number, and the user guesses what the number is. If the user's guess is correct, the program will tell them they're correct and quit out. Otherwise, the program will tell them if their guess is too high or low.

# Integers/strings
* In programming languages, we can think about data in terms of different categories. For example, we consider words and sentences ("hi friend!") to be different from integers (100), or even decimal numbers (1.2345)
* Two common data types are **integers** and **strings**
  - **Integers** are whole numbers. They can be positive or negative, but cannot be followed by a decimal point. Examples of integers include 1, 2, 5, 1000, -586003, 7575757575
  - **Strings** are sequences of characters. When using strings, we always put quotes around the word/sentence. Examples of strings include, "code", "hello world", "i love my dog"

# Variables
* Variables are used to store data values, so we can use them later.

``` my_lucky_number = 15
```

```
  my_name = "Rachel"
 ```

# Random function

# Input/output
